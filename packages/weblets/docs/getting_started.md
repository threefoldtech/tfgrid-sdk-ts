## Weblets project

Weblets are a web components which provide a UI to deploy workloads on TF Grid 3. all the backend functionality is provided by [grid_client](https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfgrid-sdk-ts/tree/development/packages/grid_client). It is a reusable component that can be injected in a HTML or a Node Web app.

## Repo structure

The repo contains two projects:

- The weblets itself as the components.
  - which written in `Svelte`
  - available in the `/` directory.
- The playground as a web app where you can try out the weblets.
  - which written in `Vue`
  - available in the `/playground` directory.

## Usage

You can use one of the live instances of the playground:

- dev environment: rapidly changing environment on development branch merges: https://play.dev.grid.tf
- qa environment: more stable environment on pre-releases: https://play.qa.grid.tf
- test environment: more stable environment on pre-releases: https://play.test.grid.tf
- stable environment: most stable / verified code, based on releases: https://play.grid.tf

Or run the playground locally:
First you need to [Install dependencies and config the environment](./config.md)

Then, to run the playground you need to first build the weblets then move the built files to the `/playground` directory. to serve it. and this can be done with `yarn serve:app` script.

```bash
yarn deps           # to install the dependencies
yarn serve:app      # to build, move, and serve the playground
```

For targeted build you can export the `TARGET_WEBLETS` environment variable to build only the weblets you want. the value is the name of the folder in `src/elements/` directory seperated by space. for example:

```bash
export TARGET_WEBLETS="vm funkwhale DeployedList"
yarn serve:app
```

To read about each weblet and how to use it, and also how to config your twin id and activate your profile on the playground you can go to the [weblets documentation](https://manual.grid.tf/weblets/weblets_profile_manager.html?highlight=profile#profile-manager).
