# funkwhale weblet

This weblet deploys a funkwhale instance with this flist
`https://hub.grid.tf/tf-official-apps/threefoldtech-funkwhale-v3.0.flist`

Currently, the weblet deploys all in one funkwhale vm on TF Grid v3, but it does not support the database persistance if the deployment is destroyed. But that will be supported in later versions.
