## Running selenium

There are two ways to run the Automation selenium tests:

- Run Tests against the local dashboard environment which installed from latest commit on development branch.

- Run Tests against any live environment (Devnet, QAnet, Testnet and Mainnet)

### First (Run Tests against local dashboard)

#### Prepare dashboard locally

- In the root directory 'tfgrid-sdk-ts/', run:

  ```bash
  yarn install
  yarn lerna run build
  make run project=playground
  ```

- You need to leave the localhost running and open a new terminal.

### Second (Run Tests against any live environment)

#### update the config files to point to the target environment

- Update the env url and some other variables directly in these files config.ini and base.py
- Ex.: to run against Mainnet

  - config.ini

    ```ini
    [Base]
    net = main
    ```

  - base.py

    ```python
    base_url = "https://dashboard.grid.tf/"
    ```

### Setup environment configurations

- Add your configuration either in [config.ini](../frontend_selenium/Config.ini) or by exporting `TFCHAIN_MNEMONICS`, `TFCHAIN_NODE_MNEMONICS`, `STELLAR_ADDRESS`, and `EMAIL`.
- Description of config under `Base` section:
  - `port`: the port that the localhost is running on.
  - `net`: the network that the tests will be run against.
- Description of config under `Utils` section:
  - `seed`: twin mnemonic that will be used for all the automated tests.
  - `node_seed`: twin mnemonic for the node that will be used in node-related tests.
  - `address`: a stellar address with a TFT trustline that will be used in TFT bridge-related tests.
  - `email`: a valid email that will be used for all the automated tests.
- If the port in serve changes from `5173` for any reason, you should update the `port` under the `Base` section in [config.ini](../frontend_selenium/Config.ini) to reflect the new value.

### Prepare tests requirements

- Change directory to frontend selenium by running `cd packages/playground/tests/frontend_selenium/` in the command line.
- Install the recommended version of the pip package listed above for a stable run, or you can just install Python 3 and use the command:
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages` (Use this if you don't use any of the listed packages).
  - Or use Virtual Environments: First, create an environment using `python -m venv myenv`, then activate it using `source myenv/bin/activate`, and finally, install packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- You'll also need to install `Xvfb`, Run `sudo apt install xvfb`.
- You can run selenium tests with pytest through the command line using `python3 -m pytest -v`.

### More options to run tests

- If you want to run the tests visually to see how they are running, you need to comment out the lines `16` and `34` in the [conftest.py](../frontend_selenium/tests/conftest.py).
- You can also run single test file through the command line using `python3 -m pytest -v tests/file/test_file.py`.
- You can also run specific test cases through the command line using `python3 -m pytest -v tests/file/test_file.py::test_func`.
- You can also run collection of test cases through the command line using `python3 -m pytest -v -k 'test_func or test_func'`.
- You can also run all the tests and get an HTML report using [pytest-html](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-html/) package through the command line using `python3 -m pytest -v --html=report.html`.
