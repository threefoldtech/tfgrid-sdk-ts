[Minting](https://www.manual.grid.tf/documentation/faq/faq.html#what-is-the-tft-minting-process-is-it-fully-automated) is based on blockchain data according to strict rules that are carried out by computers with humans involved only to check for errors and to sign the resulting transactions.

By connecting a 3Node to the Grid, you get Farming Rewards. If you set a public IP address for the Grid to use, you will receive additional rewards when your 3Node is being utilized by users on the Grid. Rewards are distributed once a month, around the 8th\*.

<br />

A user can verify the 3Nodes' payments on Stellar Blockchain through the Threefold's [minting tool](https://www.manual.grid.tf/documentation/dashboard/tfchain/tf_minting_reports.html) by using the hash receipt from the payment.
