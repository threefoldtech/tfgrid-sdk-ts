[Minting](https://manual.grid.tf/faq/faq.html?highlight=receipt%20hash#what-is-the-tft-minting-process-is-it-fully-automated) is based on blockchain data according to strict rules that are carried out by computers with humans involved only to check for errors and to sign the resulting transactions.

By connecting a 3Node to the Grid, you get Farming Rewards. If you set a public IP address for the Grid to use, you will receive additional rewards when your 3Node is being utilized by users on the Grid. Rewards are distributed once a month, around the 8th\*.

A user can [verify](https://manual.grid.tf/faq/faq.html?highlight=receipt%20hash#on-threefold-grid-v3-how-can-i-verify-my-3nodes-payments-on-stellar-blockchain) the 3Nodes' payments on Stellar Blockchain through the Threefold's minting tool by using the hash recipet from the payment.
