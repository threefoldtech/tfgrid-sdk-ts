Expose allows users to securely expose servers hosted on local machines or VMs to the public internet. Users are required to specify the machine's IP, which can be a Mycelium IP, Yggdrasil IP, or a public IP (IPv4 or IPv6). For more details, check the [Expose documentation](https://www.manual.grid.tf/documentation/dashboard/solutions/expose.html).
