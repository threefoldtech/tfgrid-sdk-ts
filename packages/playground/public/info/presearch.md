Presearch is a community-powered, decentralized search engine that provides better results while protecting your privacy and rewarding you when you search. This weblet deploys a Presearch node. Presearch Nodes are used to process user search requests, and node operators earn Presearch PRE tokens for joining and supporting the network.
