# HTML Tag Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `<pdf-signer />` and `<script-editor />` tags as web components. It serves as a guide for testing and understanding the usage of these tags.

## How to Use

To use the HTML tags `<pdf-signer />` and `<script-editor />`, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the UI repository:

```sh
$ cd packages/UI
```

2. Build the package:

```sh
$ tfgrid-sdk-ts/packages/UI: yarn build-only
```

3. Copy the `dist` folder into the `html-tag-example/dist` directory:

```sh
$ tfgrid-sdk-ts/packages/UI: cd ...
$ tfgrid-sdk-ts: cp packages/UI/dist packages/UI/src/examples/html-tag-example/dist
```

4. Run the `index.html` file in a local server and navigate to it. This will allow you to test and interact with the `<pdf-signer />` and `<script-editor />` tags within your web application.

This example provides a practical way to incorporate these web components into your projects and experiment with their functionality.

Feel free to modify the example and customize the tags according to your specific use case or project requirements.
